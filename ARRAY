Array : collection of more than one of similar items
1. compile time Array : will give the value directly in programs 
and during compile value will be assingened to array.
2. Runtime array: during pgm run values will be assinged to array and run
Compile time  array:
age              s              2s 0 dim(10) ctdata perrcd(5)      
size - 2s 0, perrcd - 5 records
function on array:
%lookup- will search the value in array and get the position 
eval      idx = %lookup(15 : age)   
eval      idx = %lookup(15 : age: 7)   (will search 15 from array positin 7)
eval      idx = %lookupge(15 : age)     (LT, GT, GE, LE)
idx = %lookup(15 : age : 1 : 6)  (will seach 15 startring from position 1 until position to 6)
for       i=1 to %elem(age)   (%elem- will give the size of array )     
subarray function: 
 eval  age1 = %subarr(age: 4: 5)    (age1 is another array and moving 5 elements from array age from starting position 4)

Prerun time array :
FARRAYf2   IT   F  100        DISK       (file arrayf2 declared as T(array))                                  
Darray1           s             10a   dim(12) fromfile(arrayf2) perrcd(2) (from file mentioned) 
No of records in file must be same as declared in pgm ( in above dim(12) means file must have 12 records)
%xlate function translate value from position to position
EVAL      X = %XLATE(UPPER:LOWER : VAR1)       
here upper and lower are variables which are intialised some value, var1 value got changed from position to position
variable name length can be 4096 for variable
