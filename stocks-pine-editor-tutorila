Defining version of the compiler

Ploting line graph for the close prices

plot(close)

variables

    = used for assingment
    := overriding existing value
    data type is optional
    var will convert the varibale in persistent varaible

Indicator
    Tells general nature of the script as this is a study Indicator
    It allows different subset of functions to work with.

    To find the parameters for the indicator, hover the mouse over the indicator text.
    , is used to seperate the parameters
    ctrl+click for opening the documentation for the indicator parameters

Indicator Parameters
        title ->
        shorttitle ->
        overlay => to plot the indicator on the chart. eg, overlay=true
        format -> Shows the selected value next to the parameters. eg. format
        precision -> Shows the decimal precision 
        scale -> To plto the prices on the desired side
        max_bars_back=10 -> this allows the script to access the number of defined bars from the current bar.
        timeframe="D" -> Graph plotting timeframe.


Namespace
        Namespace group all the similar functions under one class.
        for example all the technical analysis variables are parked under ti namespace.
        example rsi = ta.rsi(close,14)
        ctrl + space is used for getting the functions for the Namespace
        other name spaces str for string, ta for technical analysis, stratergy namespace, request

Price Series
        open, high, low, close are the default price values
        we can plot these values and any other indicator values on the chart
        historical data can be reference by [10] (for 10 days)
            e.g. atr = ta.atr(14)
                 atr10 = atr[10] -> show the atr of 10 days ago


        1. Two types of number are supported by pines script integertype and floattype
            you can use exponential values like 0.1e2 -> 01 X 10's power 2
        2. Boolean
        3. colorType in build data type e.g color.red. color.yellow
                you can use hexadecimal color as well
                also rgb color is also allowed
        5. String - > need to use "'" quotes or double quotes (") around a string value


Alerts also can be created to trigger on real time data
