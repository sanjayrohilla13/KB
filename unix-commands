Installing particular AWS cli version using pip install
    apt install python3-pip -y
    pip install awscli==1.15.19
Removing the aws cli from the system
  sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove awscli
  ln -s /home/ubuntu/.local/bin/aws /usr/bin/aws
Removing the aws cli from the system using pip
  pip uninstall awscli -y
  
Check ports being used in the host
  sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

Finding flavour or Linux
  cat /etc/os-release

Add User to specified Group
sudo gpasswd -a sanjay docker
  user name is sanjay & group name is docker in the above case.
  
Add User to Sudo Group
  sudo usermod -aG sudo sanjay
  The -aG option tells the system to append the user to the specified group. (The -a option is only used with G.)

Fix broken packages
  sudo apt --fix-missing update
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -f

removing service from autostart
  for ubuntu, remove the link from /etc/rc*.d library using the below command
    update-rc.d -f proftpd remove
  for stopping the service
    /etc/init.d/proftpd stop

Checking whether port is open or not in Linux
  - Open a Linux terminal application
  - Use ss command to display all open TCP and UDP ports in Linux.
      - sudo ss -tulpn


  - Another option is to use the netstat command to list all ports in Linux.
      - sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
        Where,
        -t : All TCP ports
        -u : All UDP ports
        -l : Display listening server sockets
        -p : Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
        -n : Don’t resolve names
        | grep LISTEN : Only display open ports by applying grep command filter.
  - Apart from ss/netstat one can use the lsof command to list open files and ports on Linux based system.
      - sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
        Where,
        -i : Look for listing ports
        -P : Inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files. Inhibiting the conversion may make lsof run a little faster. It is also useful when port name lookup is not working properly.
        -n : Do not use DNS name
        | grep LISTEN : Again only show ports in LISTEN state using the grep command as filter.
  - Finally, one can use nmap command to check TCP and UDP ports too.
        nmap command is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. We are going to use nmap to find and list open ports in Linux:
        $ sudo nmap -sT -O localhost
        $ sudo nmap -sU -O 192.168.2.254 ##[ list open UDP ports ]##
        $ sudo nmap -sT -O 127.0.0.1 ##[ list open TCP ports ]##
        $ sudo nmap -sTU -O 192.168.2.24

    The open port doesn’t mean anyone from outside can access those ports
    So far, you know how to find and list open TCP and UDP ports on Linux. However, those ports 
    can still be blocked by software, cloud, or hardware firewall. Hence, you need to verify that
    your corporate firewall is not blocking incoming or outgoing access. For instance on Linux 
    server we list or dump firewall rules using the following syntax:
      sudo iptables -S
      # IPv6
      sudo ip6tables -S
