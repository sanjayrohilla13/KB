- ansible can't be installed on windows; however, it can manage windows node easily.

Setting up ansible-control-node 
    - Provision a machine on EC2 (Amazon-Linux-2)
    - Change the hostname using below commands:
        - Temp Change   hostname <new-host-name> e.g, hostname ansible-control-node
        - Perm Change   vi /etc/hostname -> change the hostname as "ansible-control node" -> save   
                        and quit
    - Create new user for ansible (it is good to have a different user profile for ansible)
         - useradd ansibleadmin
         - userpwd ansibleadmin@123
    - add new user to sudoers file
         - visudo
         - append new user at "Allow root to run any commands anywhere
           ansadmin ALL=(ALL)         NOPAWWWD: ALL
         - save the sudo file and quit
    - switch to the ansadmin
         - sudo su -ansadmin
useruser
    - Create ssh key
        - ssh-keygen
        - keys are stored in .ssh directory
    - Start passwordless authentication
        - Amazon systems are by default set the password authentication as "No", we need to change them to 
          accept password authentication as "Yes"
        - switch to root user
        - vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        - search the "PasswordAuthentication" and set that as "yes" and comment the "No" part
        - save the file and exit the file. 
        - restart the ssh service -> service sshd restart
