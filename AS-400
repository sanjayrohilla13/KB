How to reduce ASP(Auxiliary storage for server)
1. deleting unwanted objects : how to find them?
rtvdskinf - will scan whole machine and output will be in qaez
2. Get the objects from file and check the size
DSPOBJD OBJ(CHANDRIKA1/*ALL) OBJTYPE(*FILE) OUTPUT(*OUTFILE) OUTFILE(QTEMP/x)
check big files in IFS folder
there is find command which find the directory or files which size are bigger than mentioned in the command-  /home/CHANDRIKA -xdev -size +'echo 1024 |bc'c -ls 
checking jobs and outfile in system -dspsyssts - jobs in system xxxx ( it is  the value of all the job running in the system or in jobq or just completed and are in outq(it may produce spool files dump log or etc(all takes memory)))
check journal and journal receiver
